# weatherDataAnalysis
In this project, we have used Hadoop framework to analyze the weather data of various years using MapReduce program written in Java. 
Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large datasets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
We estimate whether if itâ€™s a hot day or a cold day.
